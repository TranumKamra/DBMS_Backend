## Distributed Database Management and RSA Encryption System with Django
# Project Overview
This project showcases a sophisticated back-end system developed using Django, focusing on two key features: a distributed database management system and an RSA encryption/decryption mechanism. The project emphasizes advanced database configurations, data security, and efficient version control, demonstrating proficiency in both system design and implementation.

# Features
Distributed Database Management System

# Implemented a distributed database architecture with master-slave configuration.
Incorporated voting mechanisms for updating databases to ensure consistency and high availability.
Designed to handle high volumes of transactions efficiently, reducing bottlenecks and enhancing performance.
RSA Encryption and Decryption

# Developed an RSA encryption and decryption system from scratch.
Utilized threading and operating system principles to optimize encryption processes.
Ensured robust data security through custom cryptographic algorithms.
Version Control and Data Integrity

# Integrated a version control system to manage and track changes to the database.
Enabled seamless rollbacks and ensured data integrity throughout the system.
Leveraged threading to enhance the performance of the encryption and decryption operations.
